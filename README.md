# Coronavirus-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-ML-Project
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts the sentiment of COVID-19-related tweets. The dataset used for this project consists of tweets gathered from Twitter, which have been manually tagged with sentiment labels. To protect user privacy, the names and usernames have been replaced with codes.
# Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:

Username: Coded username to ensure privacy.

ScreenName: Coded screen name for privacy protection.

Location: The region of origin of the tweet.

TweetAt: The timing of the tweet.

OriginalTweet: The content of the tweet.

Sentiment-Target variable: Sentiment of the tweet
# The objective of this  project is to develop a classification model that predicts the sentiment of COVID-19-related tweets.steps involved in this  project:
1.  Loading the data into data frame 
2.  Understanding the Variables
3.  Data Vizualization
4.  Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing
5.  Textual Data Preprocessing
6.	Train Test Split 
7.	Logistic Regression
8.	Naive Bayes Classifier
9.	Support Vector Machine
10.	Random Forest


# Results
Based on results, the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy and precision among the tested models. It performed relatively well in predicting the sentiment of the tweets.

In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict sentiment in COVID-19-related tweets. The Logistic Regression model showed the best performance in this project.
